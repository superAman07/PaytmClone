# Build a Basic Version of PayTM

The User Management & Money Transfer System is a web application that simulates a money transfer platform similar to Paytm. Users can sign up, manage their contacts, and easily transfer money to anyone in their contact list. The application ensures that all user data is stored securely in a MongoDB database, providing a seamless experience for users to access and manage their contacts.

## Features
- **User Registration**: New users can create an account by providing their details, which are securely stored in the database.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login process to ensure user data privacy and integrity.
- **Dashboard**: Upon login, users are redirected to a dashboard displaying their contact list, enabling easy access to all registered users.
- **Money Transfer**: Users can initiate money transfers to contacts directly from their dashboard.
- **Search Functionality**: A search feature allows users to quickly find specific contacts in their list.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive, providing an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
### Frontend
